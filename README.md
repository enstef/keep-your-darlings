<h1>Keep Your Darlings</h1>
<h4>Final Project for Ironhack Webdev Bootcamp</h4>
<br>
<p>To all the Fashoin Addicts out there: <i>Keep Your Darlings</i> is the solution for organizing a closet so wonderful and diverse (we're not saying <i>too full</i>) that you lost track of it. Document your outfits and maybe even sort your not-so-beloved darlings out.
<hr>
<p>Fullstack Project using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js Node.js, Sass/CSS and HTML5.
<hr>
<p>Clone this poject, npm install, server on and off you go! Also this setup is ready to deploy to Heroku. Remember you will need the mlab extension.</p>
